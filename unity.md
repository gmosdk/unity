##2. Client API <a name="head1-client-api"> </a>

###2.1 Init and setup SDK <a name = "head2-init-sdk"> </a>
Related class and function:  
[AppotaSDKHandler](class-document/UnityClasses.html#init-function)  
[AppotaSDKReceiver](class-document/UnityClasses.html#appota-sdk-receiver)    
Appota SDK init must be called once when application start via [AppotaSDKHandler](class-document/UnityClasses.html#init-function) class call `AppotaSDKHandler.Instance.Init()` so most of the time it will be called in your first scene

```
AppotaSDKHandler.Instance.Init();
```

There are some functions to control SDK flows:

- `SetKeepLoginSession(BOOL)` <a name="set-keep-login-session"> </a> this function will control the Appota Login Session will be kept or removed at app lauching (when session's removed user has to login again when app start).   
**Note** If this function is not called, login session will be kept by default.
- `SetAutoShowLogin(BOOL)` <a name="set-auto-show-login-dialog"> </a> this function will control the Appota Login View will be automatically show at app lauching (when user's not logged in) or you have to call [ShowLoginView](#show-login-view) function to show the LoginView.   
**Note** If this function is not called, login view will automatically show at app lauching (when user's not logged in)

- `SetSDKButtonVisible(BOOL)` call this function to setting hide or show SDK floating button

- `FinishSDK()` call this function in `OnApplicationQuit` script

Once you've implemented init SDK function, start using login features.

####2.2.1. Show login view <a name = "head2-show-login-view"> </a>
As mentioned above login dialog flow can be control by function [SetAutoShowLoginDialog(BOOL)](#set-auto-show-login-dialog). Automatically show login view at app launching or manual call `ShowLoginView` when you need:  

- ** Show Login View **

```
AppotaSDKHandler.Instance.ShowLoginView();

```
<a name="show-login-view"> </a>

```

- ** Switch account function **

Call this function when you want to switch logged in user to other Appota User. Remember to check callback after switching successful (it'll be called in `OnLoginSucceed` again)
```
AppotaSDKHandler.Instance.SwitchAccount();
```

- ** Show User Info function **

This function will show user profile view  

```
AppotaSDKHandler.Instance.ShowUserInfo();

```
- ** Check user login **
This function will return user logged in state

```

AppotaSDK provide 4 callbacks delegate for login defined in [`AppotaSDKReceiver`](class-document/UnityClasses.html#appota-sdk-receiver) , please implement these functions to handle login result

----
**Login succeed callback**  
Retreive Appota user info from `AppotaSession` then post to your server to verify and create game user. For more detail about user integration on server: [User Integration](https://github.com/appota/ios-game-sdk/wiki/Integrate-user-system)  

**Note** Remember verify Appota UserID, UserName and Access token on your server before procceeding game user integration

```
public void  OnLoginSucceed(string appotaSession)

```
|Parameter|Description|  
|-------|-----------|  
|appotaSession|`appotaSession` is a json string included all user info, convert the string to AppotaSession ot easily retrevie user information (`AppotaSession.Appota_AccessToken`, `AppotaSession.Appota_UserName`) |

** Callback for payment state **

** YOU HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THIS FUNCTION TO ENSURE GOLD CHARING CORRECTLY **  
**PAYMENT_STATE** is required for our SDK to make correct payment with package. Depends on your payment package implement this function and return a correct payment state.  
For example packageID: `com.gold.package1` - (defined in integration process) corresponds with a package of 1000 gold and current game user is X in server Y. Then payment state can be constructed : com.gold.package1_1000_gold_X_Y (depends on your format).

```
public void GetPaymentState(string packageID);

```
|Parameter|Description|  
|-------|-----------|  
|`packageID`|`packageID` is id of the package has been bought, `packageID` is defined during payment configuration process|

##4. FAQ and Glossary <a name="head1-faq"></a>
- `IPN` is payment machenism used by Appota System to increase gold for game user. Detail in https://github.com/appota/ios-game-sdk/wiki/Passive-Confirmation-via-IPN
- `PackageID` each payment package in game should be defined along with a package ID (provided by SDKTool) to identify package.
- `PaymentState` payment state must be implemented in `GetPaymentState` function. And use `PackageID` and game server information to build up `PaymentState`.   
For example packageID: `com.gold.package1` - (defined in integration process) corresponds with a package of 1000 gold and current game user is X in server Y. Then payment state can be constructed : com.gold.package1_1000_gold_X_Y (depends on your format).
