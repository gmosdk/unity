##2. Client API <a name="head1-client-api"> </a>

###2.1 Init and setup SDK <a name = "head2-init-sdk"> </a>
Related class and function:  
[AppotaSDKHandler](class-document/UnityClasses.md#init-function)  
[AppotaSDKReceiver](class-document/UnityClasses.md#appota-sdk-receiver)    
Appota SDK init must be called once when application start via [AppotaSDKHandler](class-document/UnityClasses.md#init-function) class call `AppotaSDKHandler.Instance.Init()` so most of the time it will be called in your first scene

```
AppotaSDKHandler.Instance.Init();
```

There are some functions to control SDK flows, have to call them after `AppotaSDKHandler.Instance.Init()`

- `SetKeepLoginSession(BOOL)` <a name="set-keep-login-session"> </a> this function will control the Appota Login Session will be kept or removed at app lauching (when session's removed user has to login again when app start).   
**Note** If this function is not called, login session will be kept by default.
- `SetAutoShowLoginDialog(BOOL)` <a name="set-auto-show-login-dialog"> </a> this function will control the Appota Login View will be automatically show at app lauching (when user's not logged in) or you have to call [ShowLoginView](#show-login-view) function to show the LoginView.   
**Note** If this function is not called, login view will automatically show at app lauching (when user's not logged in)

- `SetSDKButtonVisibility(BOOL)` call this function to setting hide or show SDK floating button

- `FinishSDK()` call this function in `OnApplicationQuit` script
###2.2. User function <a name="head2-user-function"> </a>
Related class and function:

- [AppotaSDKHandler](class-document/UnityClasses.md#user-function)
- [AppotaSDKReceiver](class-document/UnityClasses.md#user-callback)
- [AppotaSession](class-document/UnityClasses.md#appota-session)

Once you've implemented init SDK function, start using login features.

####2.2.1. Show login view <a name = "head2-show-login-view"> </a>
As mentioned above login dialog flow can be control by function [SetAutoShowLoginDialog(BOOL)](#set-auto-show-login-dialog). Automatically show login view at app launching or manual call `ShowLoginView` when you need:  

- **Show Login View**

```
AppotaSDKHandler.Instance.ShowLoginView();

```
<a name="show-login-view"> </a>
Appota Login Dialog contains 5 authorization methods: **Facebook**, **Google**, **Twitter**, **Appota User** and **Quick Login**  

![Appota Login Dialog](images/login_dialog.png)

Follow this mechanism for login function, please implement [`didLoginSuccess`](#did-login-succeed) callback to authenticate your in-game user.
![Appota Login Mechanism](images/unity_login_user_sequence.png)


- **Logout function**
 
```
AppotaSDKHandler.Instance.Logout();
```

- **Switch account function**

Call this function when user logged in will show a login view and allow to login other account. When switch account succeed `OnLoginSucceed` callback will be called again, so please logout your game account and reauthenticate with new switched account.

```
AppotaSDKHandler.Instance.SwitchAccount();
```

###2.2. Payment function <a name="head2-payment-function"> </a>

Related class and function:

- [AppotaSDKHandler - payment function](class-document/UnityClasses.md#payment-function)
- [AppotaSDKReceiver](class-document/UnityClasses.md#payment-callback)
- [AppotaPaymentResult](class-document/UnityClasses.md#appota-payment-result)

Because using AppotaSDK payment function you should understand Appota Payment mechanism and configuration. Please study Appota payment mechanism at [Appota Payment Document](https://github.com/appota/ios-game-sdk/wiki/Passive-Confirmation-via-IPN) and payment configuration at [Appota Developer Portal]().

####2.2.1. Show payment view <a name="head3-show-payment-view"> </a>

---------
You have 3 methods to show payment view. Each payment view represents one or list of payment package. Each package contains information of game coin amount or in-game package.

**Show default list payment view**

You can show payment view with default list payment packages (which is configured on [Appota Developer Portal]())

```
AppotaSDKHandler.Instance.ShowPaymentView()
```
![](images/list_item.gif)

----
**Show payment view for a specific package**

You can show a specific package depends on your in-game mechanism

```
AppotaGameSDK.Instance.ShowPaymentViewWithPackageID(string packageID)
```

![](images/one_item.gif)

----
**Show payment view from SDK floating button**  
User can open Payment, Information and Transaction History view via floating button

(Show image of floating button and then SDK show gif)


####2.2.2 Handle payment callback <a name="head3-handle-payment-callback"> </a>

---------
You have to implement and modified all callbacks in `AppotaSDKReceiver`.

**Callback after a successful payment**

Depends on your payment machenism (IPN, please readmore about [Appota Payment](https://github.com/appota/ios-game-sdk/wiki/Integrate-payment-system)), proceed payment verification or alert payment succeed for user

```
public void OnPaymentSuccess(string transactionResult);
```

|Parameter|Description|  
|-------|-----------|  
|`transactionResult`|`transactionResult` is is a json string included all payment  info (amount, game currency, package id), convert the string to `AppotaPaymentResult` ot easily retrevie payment information|

----
**Callback for payment state**

** YOU HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THIS FUNCTION TO ENSURE GOLD CHARING CORRECTLY **  
**PAYMENT_STATE** is required for our SDK to make correct payment with package. Depends on your payment package implement this function and return a correct payment state.  
For example packageID: `com.gold.package1` - (defined in integration process) corresponds with a package of 1000 gold and current game user is X in server Y. Then payment state can be constructed : com.gold.package1_1000_gold_X_Y (depends on your format).

```
public void GetPaymentState(string packageID);

```
|Parameter|Description|  
|-------|-----------|  
|`packageID`|`packageID` is id of the package has been bought, `packageID` is defined during payment configuration process|

##4. FAQ and Glossary <a name="head1-faq"></a>
- When using SDK in games with server and game user support. To prevent user to make payment before entering the game (actually choose server and game user). You should call `SetSDKButtonVisibility(False)` when configure the SDK and then call `SetSDKButtonVisibility(True)` when game user is ready.
- `IPN` is payment machenism used by Appota System to increase gold for game user. Detail in https://github.com/appota/ios-game-sdk/wiki/Passive-Confirmation-via-IPN . Each app in Appota system will be configured with only one `IPN` url to callback when payment.
- `PackageID` each payment package in game should be defined along with a package ID (provided by SDKTool) to identify package.
- `PackageID` each payment package in game should be defined along with a package ID (provided by SDKTool) to identify package.
- `PaymentState` payment state must be implemented in `GetPaymentState` function. And use `PackageID` and game server information to build up `PaymentState`.   
For example packageID: `com.gold.package1` - (defined in integration process) corresponds with a package of 1000 gold and current game user is X in server Y. Then payment state can be constructed : com.gold.package1_1000_gold_X_Y (depends on your format).
